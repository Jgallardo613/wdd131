    <h1>Aeroweather Website Plan (WDD 131 Project)</h1>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h2>1. Site Name</h2>
    <p><strong>Aeroweather</strong></p>
    <p>Description: The name 'Aeroweather' was chosen because it is a clear, concise, and professional name that immediately communicates the site's focus on providing current and forecast weather information.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>2. Site Purpose</h2>
    <p>The purpose of Aeroweather is to provide a single, easy-to-use platform where users can track current weather conditions, 7-day forecasts, and other essential meteorological data for multiple cities around the world.</p>
    
    <hr>

    <h2>3. Scenarios</h2>
    <p>These questions represent the needs of our target audience (travelers and users monitoring distant family/locations).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Business Traveler Scenario:</strong> "What is the expected high and low temperature, and chance of precipitation, in three different cities (e.g., London, Tokyo, and Chicago) for my business trip next Tuesday?"
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Family Check-in Scenario:</strong> "I need to quickly check the current weather conditions, including any severe weather alerts, for my family in Miami, Florida."
        </li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>4. Color Schema</h2>
    <p>The selected colors are designed to be clean, professional, and associated with weather/sky elements.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Primary Color: Deep Sky Blue (#00BFFF)</strong>
            <p>This vibrant blue will be used for primary elements such as main headings (h1, h2), interactive elements (links and buttons), and to represent positive or 'clear sky' weather conditions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Secondary Color: White (#FFFFFF)</strong>
            <p>White will serve as the main background color for the body of the site, providing a clean, bright, and modern feel, and ensuring high contrast for the text.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Text Color: Dark Gray (#333333)</strong>
            <p>A dark gray will be used for all body text and paragraphs for a slightly softer, more professional look than pure black, ensuring great readability against the white background.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>5. Typography</h2>
    <p>We will use a clean, modern, sans-serif font for readability across all devices.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Font: Arial / Helvetica (Sans-Serif)</strong>
            <p>This font family will be used for all text (headings and body). Its high legibility and availability on most systems ensure a consistent and professional look for displaying numerical weather data and text descriptions.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>6. Wireframe</h2>
    <p>The wireframes show the proposed layout of the home page for different screen sizes. (Note: These descriptions act as placeholders for the actual sketch images.)</p>
    
    <h3>Mobile View (Narrow Screen)</h3>
    <p>The mobile layout will prioritize a single column, making all elements easy to access. The layout will include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Header (Menu button, Logo, City Search field)</li>
        <li>Main Panel with Current Location Weather (Large icon, Temperature, Summary)</li>
        <li>3-Day Forecast Cards (Stacked vertically)</li>
        <li>Scrollable List of Tracked Cities</li>
        <li>Footer (Links, Copyright)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Large View (Wide Desktop)</h3>
    <p>The desktop layout uses a multi-panel approach to display more information simultaneously. The layout will include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Header/Navigation (Full links, Logo, City Search)</li>
        <li><strong>Left Panel:</strong> Current Location Weather (Large detailed panel)</li>
        <li><strong>Right Panel:</strong> 7-Day Forecast (Cards displayed side-by-side)</li>
        <li>Bottom Section: Quick-View Cards for Tracked Cities</li>
        <li>Footer (Links, Copyright)</li>
    </ul>
